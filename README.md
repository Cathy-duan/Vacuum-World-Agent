Consider that the geography of the environment is not just two squares but a grid. The agent can go Up and Down as well as L and R. Consider also that the dirtiness of a grid square is not binary but is a continuum; thus the value is between 0 and 1. The objective is to pick up the maximum amount of dirt it can, within some time constraint, which is specified in terms of the number of moves.
